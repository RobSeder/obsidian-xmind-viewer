XMind Viewer is a simple plugin for Obsidian that allows you to view XMind files directly 
within your Obsidian vault. This plugin handles opening files with the .xmind extension and 
creates a new XMind viewer for that file.

## Features

   directory in your Obsidian vault. Alternatively, you can download and install it from Obsidian under Community plugins.
2. **Enable the plugin**: Go to Obsidian settings (Settings â†’ Community plugins) and activate XMind Viewer.

## Usage

Simply open a `.xmind` file within your vault, and the plugin will automatically render its contents for viewing.
